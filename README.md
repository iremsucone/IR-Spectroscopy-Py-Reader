# IR-Spectroscopy-Py-Reader

### **Infrared Spectroscopy Spectrum Python Reader (4000 cm⁻¹ to 400 cm⁻¹)**  

This Python script processes and identifies peaks in an **Infrared (IR) spectroscopy spectrum image** within the range of **4000 cm⁻¹ to 400 cm⁻¹**. It helps analyze IR spectra by calibrating wave numbers and detecting peaks accurately.  

### **How to Use:**  

1. **Setup:**  
   - Download the folder and **delete** the provided example spectrum.  
   - Replace it with your own spectrum image, ensuring it is named **exactly** as `spectrum.jpg`.  

2. **Running the Script:**  
   - Launch the script.  
   - You will be prompted to **define** key wave numbers (4000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 600 cm⁻¹) directly on the image.  
   - This step calibrates the distances for accurate peak detection.  

3. **Peak Identification:**  
   - Once calibration is complete, you can begin analyzing and identifying peaks.  

4. **Exit the Program:**  
   - Use **Ctrl + C** to exit the script safely.
